# 📚 DocsChat – Your Interactive Document Companion

**DocsChat** is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that transforms your documents into an interactive chat experience. Instead of endlessly scrolling, you can upload your files, ask natural questions, and receive clear, context-aware answers — all thanks to the synergy of **Ollama**, **LangChain**, and **ChromaDB**.
